# Data-Alchemy
Initial creations in a data based world
This repository is my workshop, a place to turn raw information into structured meaning.
Each script, notebook, or dataset here reflects a small act of refinement: learning how to extract clarity from complexity.

# Purpose
To practice the craft of data handling, automation, and analytics through hands-on creation, learning by doing rather than by theory.

# Structure
/scripts - practical Python automations (file parsing, cleanup, summaries)
/notebooks - exploratory data works and analysis
/projects - integrated builds (e.g., Uni-Fi Tracker, Process Pulse)
/notes - refelctions, lessons, and journal entries

# Principles
Clarity over complexity - the simplest code that works is the best teacher.
Iteration over perfection - every commit is refinement in motion.
Meaning over metrics - data is only valuable when it reveals something true.

# Current Focus
Exploring how small automations and data tools can improve flow, insight, and decision-making within real-world creative and operational systems.
